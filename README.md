# GMB-KAN: Gated Multi-Basis Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series Anomaly Detection

Official implementation of the paper: **"GMB-KAN: Gated Multi-Basis Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series Anomaly Detection"**.

GMB-KAN is a physics-informed architecture that adaptively unifies multiple domain-specific experts (Wavelet, Chebyshev, and Fourier bases) through a learnable gating mechanism to resolve the fundamental "Forecasting-Reconstruction Dilemma" in Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD).

## 🌟 Key Contributions

- **Novel Multi-Basis Architecture**: Introduces a Gated Multi-Basis framework that achieves precise time-frequency localization by adaptively integrating DWT, Chebyshev, and Fourier bases.

- **Resolution of the TSAD Dilemma**: Theoretically and empirically addresses the "identity mapping" issue in forecasting models and the "underfitting" limitations in reconstruction paradigms.

- **SOTA Performance**: Specifically, GMB-KAN achieves a **0.9132 PA-AUPRC** on the UCR dataset, representing an **11.5% relative gain** over the previous best-in-class method, KAN-AD.

- **Robustness in Heterogeneous Environments**: Demonstrates superior discriminative power across diverse and complex real-world signal distributions.

1. Create Environment

   ```
   conda create -n gmbkan python=3.9 -y
   conda activate gmbkan
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Experimental Results

Empirically, GMB-KAN sets a new performance frontier. The following table highlights the performance (PA-AUPRC) on the UCR benchmark:

| **Method**                 | **UCR (Avg)** | **Improvement (Rel.)** |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Transformer-AD             | 0.7241        | -                      |
| VAE-based                  | 0.7812        | -                      |
| KAN-AD (Zhou et al., 2024) | 0.8188        | Baseline               |
| **GMB-KAN (Ours)**         | **0.9132**    | **+11.5%**             |
